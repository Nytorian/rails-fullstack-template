Pull Requests
-------------
Here are some reasons why a pull request may not be merged:

1. It hasnâ€™t been reviewed.
2. It doesnâ€™t include specs for new functionality.
3. It doesnâ€™t include correct commit message.
4. It changes behavior without changing the relevant comments, or specs.
5. It breaks the tests on a supported platform.
6. It doesnâ€™t merge cleanly (requiring Git rebasing and conflict resolution).
